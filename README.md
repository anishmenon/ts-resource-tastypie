# Ts Resource Tastypie
[RESTful](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ws-restful/) TypeScript client for [Django-Tastypie](https://django-tastypie.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) or equivalent schema.

Features:

## Context
[RESTful](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ws-restful/) architecture with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

IMPORTANT:
> - Backend: Security rules for data persistence and access.
> - Frontend: [Usability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability) rules, only!

BENEFITS:
> - Asynchronous development between frontend and backend developers.
> - Reuse of web developers team to create mobile applications.
> - The frontend is isolated, we can distribute it as an application by using [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/).
> - Independent layers between business rules and usability rules of user interface. 
> - Business rules are the same for different types of [UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface). We can create different [UIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface) with any other programming language, passing through the same business rules on the backend.
